		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Creamy, smooth and with a delicious touch of brown
			sugar, this iced milk tea will improve your mornings.
			Simple to make and totally addicting, you’ll never
			drink iced tea in any different way!
		</p>
		<p>
			My milk tea can transform even the worst rainy Monday
			into a beautiful warm (Satur)day. It’s so ridiculously
			easy to put together your kids can help you do it! You
			only need milk, brown sugar and strong black tea. A
			bit of heavy cream is totally optional and you can
			save it for when having an extra awful day.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>⅔ cup water</li>
			<li>
				3 black tea bags
				<sup>or 1 tablespoon loose black tea</sup>
			</li>
			<li>1 ⅓ cups whole milk cold</li>
			<li>¼ cup heavy cream plus 2 tablespoon (36ml)</li>
			<li>2 tablespoon packed brown sugar</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Using a stove or electric kettle, boil the water.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a cup, place the black tea bags and pour the hot
				water over it. Let steep for 5 minutes. Don’t rush
				it, or you’ll end up with a weak black tea, and
				that’s not good for milk tea.
			</li>
			<li>
				Gently press all the liquid out of the tea bags and
				remove them from the cup. Stir the brown sugar until
				dissolved and wait for the mixture to cool to room
				temperature. If using black tea leaves, remove the
				leaves.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a small bowl, pour ¼ cup of heavy cream plus 1
				teaspoon of the black tea and whip it until frothed.
				Whip only until frothed, or the whipped cream won’t
				mix with your drink properly.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a jar, pour the milk and the remaining 2
				tablespoons of heavy cream. Add the already
				sweetened and cooled black tea and mix until well
				combined.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fill half a glass with ice. Pour enough milk tea to
				fill the glass, top with frothed cream and enjoy.
			</li>
		</ol>
